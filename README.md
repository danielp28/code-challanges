A repo for 30 minute coding challenges


# Feb 29th 
A button that will display a random name of an aminal in our house. This one was a little too easy, we will up the anti next time.

# Mar 2nd 
A movie searching app using the omdb API. Was able to capture user inputs and have the movie be displayed below within the 30 minute window. Completed the app by saving past user searches as buttons that can be clicked to redisplay the movie. This one was a little too hard for 30 minutes, lets find the happy medium.


# Mar 5th
A Rock-Paper-Scissors game coded using JavaScript. This one was just the right amount of difficult, with 5 minutes remaining on my timer

# Mar 6th
A simple stopwatch using JavaScript. Tried to implement miliseconds but was unable to get seconds to reset to 0 after 60.

# Mar 10th
A simple JS app that allows for user input of meals consumed on a certain day and displays them back. Super simplistic, does not save to localStorage and does not save after exit.

# Mar 11th
A MySQL database app that tracks in-game statistics such as kills, time alive and games played. DNF

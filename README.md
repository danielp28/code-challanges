A button that will display a random name of an aminal in our house. This one was a little too easy, we will up the anti next time.

A movie searching app using the omdb API. Was able to capture user inputs and have the movie be displayed below withing the 30 minute window. Completed the app by saving past user searches as buttons that can be clicked to redisplay the movie. This one was a little too hard for 30 minutes, lets find the happy medium.
